## This code won't work

Since there is only one analog Pin A0 on ESP8266. I've tried using a multiplexer ADS1115 but there was some exception I tried to decode the stack trace to understand what was going on but unfortunately the same exception was getting printed on the Serial Monitor.

At most I used one Analog Sensor and one DHT sensor(this one works on another pins). If you know or find the solution then please ping me:)
